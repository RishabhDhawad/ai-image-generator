Utilizes the OpenAI API and the DALL-E model to generate original images based on user-provided text descriptions. The project also has a front-end interface built using Javascript, allowing users to easily generate their own images.

## API
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/)

## Building
To build this you must have git installed. Paste the following command in a directory of your choice.
Alternatively, you can download the code as a .zip file and extract it.
```git
git clone https://github.com/RishabhDhawad/ai-image-generator.git
cd ai-image-generator
```

If you want to add your own OpenAI API key do so by creating a .env file inside the root of the project.

```js
// Inside script.js file
const API_KEY = "Your_Key_Goes_Here"
```
